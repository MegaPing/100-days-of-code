# Rules of my 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

## Start Date: January 7, 2025

## My Plan
1. I will code for at least 1 hour every day for the next 100 days
2. I will tweet about my progress every day on my [twitter](https://x.com/autodidactdiary) account
3. I will update the `log.md` file in this repo with the day's progress and provide a commit link so that others can check my progress.
4. I will push a commit to this GitHub repo every day
5. I will work through FreeCodeCamp's curriculum courses:
    - [ ] Responsive Web Design
    - [ ] JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures
    - [ ] Frontend Development Libraries
    - [ ] Relational Databases
    - [ ] Backend Development and APIs
6. I will encourage at least two other people in the same challenge on Twitter every day


## The Ultimate Goal
Build [anthonyavelar.com](https://anthonyavelar.com/) into a portfolio website that has a cool 8-bit RPG videogame aesthetic!

Design the website so that it has these features:
- a splash page with a cool animated message to welcome visitors
- a code projects section
- an art gallery
- a blog section
- a contact form
